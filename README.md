# ALX Low Level Programming



## Abouts

Low level programming is any language in which you handle memory management, Any language where that memory management or garbage collection is done for you, which is now most languages, is considered “high level.” 

Low-level languages are useful because programs written in them can be crafted to run very fast and with a very minimal memory footprint. However, they are considered harder to utilize because they require a deeper knowledge of machine language.

C is considered as a low-level languages because it  has no automatic memory management.

## Concepts

in this C project we looked into the following concepts in C:

* C HELLO WORLD (INTRODUCTION).
* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x03-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x04-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07. C - Recursion](./0x07-recursion)
* [0x08. C - Static libraries](./0x08-static_libraries)
* [0x09. C - argc, argv](./0x09-argc_argv)
* [0x0A. C - malloc, free](./0x0A-malloc_free)
* [0x0B. C - More malloc, free](./0x0B-more_malloc_free)
* [0x0C. C - Preprocessor](./0x0C-preprocessor)
* [0x0D. C - Structures, typedef](./0x0D-structures_typedef)
* [0x0E. C - Function pointers](./0x0E-function_pointers)
* [0x0F. C - Variadic functions](./0x0F-variadic_functions)
* [0x10. C - printf](https://github.com/aycrown1/printf)
* [0x11. C - Singly linked lists](./0x11-singly_linked_lists)
* [0x12. C - More singly linked lists](./0x12-more_singly_linked_lists)
* [0x13. C - Bit manipulation](./0x13-bit_manipulation)
* [0x14. C - File I/O](./0x14-file_io)
* [0x15. C - Simple Shell](https://github.com/aycrown1/simple_shell)
* [0x16. C - Doubly linked lists](./0x16-doubly_linked_lists)
* [0x17. C - Dynamic libraries](./0x17-dynamic_libraries)
* [0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO](https://github.com/ayrown1/monty)

All this concepts where use in creating the `C PRINTF FUNTION`  and ` SIMPLE SHELL IN C`
