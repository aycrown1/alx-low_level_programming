# ALX Low Level Programming



## Abouts

Low level programming is any language in which you handle memory management, Any language where that memory management or garbage collection is done for you, which is now most languages, is considered “high level.” 

Low-level languages are useful because programs written in them can be crafted to run very fast and with a very minimal memory footprint. However, they are considered harder to utilize because they require a deeper knowledge of machine language.

C is considered as a low-level languages because it  has no automatic memory management.

## Concepts

in this C project we looked into the following concepts in C:

* C HELLO WORLD
* C VARIABLES, IF ELSE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS AND WHILE LOOOPS
* C FUNCTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS (FOR AND WHILE LOOPS).
* C DEBUGGING.
* C POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS.
* C RECURSION.
* C STATIC LIBRARIES.
* C ARGUMENTS (ARGC AND ARGV).
* C MEMORY ALLOCATION AND FREE.
* C PREPROCESSORS.
* C STRUCTURE AND TYPEDEF.
* C LINKED LISTS.
* C BIT MANIPULATIONS.
* C FILE ( INPUTS AND OUTPUTS).


All this concepts where use in creating the `C PRINTF FUNTION`  and ` SIMPLE SHELL IN C`
