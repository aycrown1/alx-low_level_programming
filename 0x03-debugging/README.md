# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Debugging in C

 Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a computer program. In C, debugging is an essential part of the software development process to ensure that the program runs as intended.

## Methods of debugging manually in C

 Some methods of debugging manually in C include:

Using print statements to output the values of variables at different stages of the program to check if they match the expected values.

Using a debugger tool to step through the program, set breakpoints, and examine the state of the program at various points.

Examining the error messages and warnings produced by the compiler to identify potential issues in the code.

## Reading error messages in C

 Error messages in C provide information about the source of the error, the line number, and the type of error that occurred. 
They are often displayed in the compiler output or terminal window. It is essential to read and understand the error messages to identify and fix any issues in the code. 

Common error messages in C include 

`"syntax error,"` `"undeclared variable,"` `"out of range,"` `"segmentation fault,"` and `"stack overflow."`

 The error messages often include additional information about the error, such as the function or file where the error occurred. By carefully reading and interpreting the error messages, developers can quickly identify and fix bugs in the program.
