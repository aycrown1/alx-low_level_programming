## 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

**Introduction**
Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type *"https://www.google.com"* in your browser on your personal computer or phone and press enter? This classic question assesses the general knowledge of how the web stack functions on top of the internet. The seemingly simple action triggers a complex series of operations involving various technologies working seamlessly to display the desired web page. The journey begins when you, the client, input the URL *"https://www.google.com"* in your preferred browser, such as `Chrome`, `Safari`, `Opera`, etc., and press enter. Let's delve into the fascinating sequence of operations that unfold after you initiate this process.

- **DNS Request:**
Your browser initiates a `Domain Name System (DNS)` request to translate the user-friendly domain name "`www.google.com`" into an IP address. The DNS server translates this name into a numerical IP address that the computer comprehends, enabling your device to pinpoint the specific server location of Google on the internet.

- **TCP/IP:**
Once the browser obtains the correct IP address, it initiates a `Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)` connection. This protocol establishes a reliable and orderly connection between the browser and Google's server, maintaining the integrity of the transmitted information.

- **Firewall Protection:**
A firewall acts as a vigilant guard, monitoring and controlling both incoming and outgoing network traffic. It examines the validity of the incoming web request, fortifying your device against potential cyber threats and unauthorized access attempts.

- **HTTPS/SSL Encryption:**
With an emphasis on security, the `Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)` comes into play. The `Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)` ensures the encryption of data transmitted between your browser and the Google server, preventing unauthorized interception and safeguarding the confidentiality of your information.

- **Load-Balancer:**
To manage high traffic volume, Google employs a load-balancer that evenly distributes incoming requests across multiple servers. This balancing mechanism ensures optimal performance and prevents any single server from becoming overloaded, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Web Server:**
The web server receives your request and processes it, retrieving the relevant webpage or data from the server's storage. In Google's case, the web server promptly responds to your request, sending back the required web page to your browser.

- **Application Server:**
For dynamic content, an application server comes into play. It processes the request, executes complex application logic, and generates dynamic web content tailored to your specific needs, enhancing the overall user experience with personalized and interactive elements.

- **Database:**
Behind the scenes, a sophisticated database management system stores and manages the vast amount of data that powers Google's search engine. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update the necessary information, ensuring seamless data retrieval and storage operations.

**Conclusion:**
The seemingly instantaneous act of typing a URL into your browser and accessing a website conceals a complex process involving multiple systems and protocols working seamlessly to provide a smooth and secure user experience, which takes milliseconds to bring up your response. Understanding these layers sheds light on the intricate infrastructure that supports the modern web, enabling us to appreciate the technical marvel behind every web interaction. Next time you use your browser to access a website's URL, think of it as using a magical messenger (your browser) that can bring you anything you want from a huge library (the server of the website).
