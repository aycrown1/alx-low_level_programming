# 0x0D-preprocessor

Preprocessor is a program that processes a source code file before it is passed to the compiler.

To make this Script we make use of the gcc compiler and the -E option that invoke the preprocessor without compling or using the linker.

There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants, and macros. 

Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip part of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro.
Preprocessor directives are instructions that are processed by the preprocessor before the code is compiled. 

The preprocessor Derectives include:

* #define: used to define macros or constants.
* #ifdef and #ifndef: used to perform conditional compilation based on whether a certain macro is defined or not.
* #pragma: used to provide implementation-specific instructions to the compiler.
