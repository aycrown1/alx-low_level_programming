# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## C Variables


Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.

In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords)

 - `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals.

 - `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals.

 - `char` - stores single characters. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

Variables are created using this Syntax 

```
type variableName = value;

```
 For example:

```c
int my_int_variable = 2023;

```
